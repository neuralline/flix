> clone git to local machine 'yarn install' then 'yarn start' <br>
> or npm install then npm start

to initiate

```js
flix('dom element id', 'url')
```

In this project

```sh
TypeScript, JavaScript, async/await, recursive functions, dom manipulation, svg and css animation, pixel perfect ui design, css sass and also unit testing
```

> Its written in functional javascript to avoid mutation however there is a lot of dom interaction going on in this app so it was hard to keep all component pure. I admit this would have been great with OOP class based mutation but FLIX managed with recursive function and Promise chains.

this app uses no external library\* <br>
tries minimise dom interaction\*<br>
avoids mutation\*<br>
